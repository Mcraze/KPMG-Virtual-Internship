## Here are some interesting findings I discovered through this analysis 🔍 
- I identified the top customers who bring in the highest average profit, and it would be wise to target them to boost our sales. 🔝
- The visualization clearly showed that New South Wales had a major impact on our overall profits. 📈
- I also calculated the average profits for different bike brands, which can help the organization identify the most promising brands to invest in and maximize profits in the coming years. 🚲
- Interestingly, the majority of our customers are females, and they contribute significantly to our total profits. Based on this, I suggest that we focus on creating more gender-neutral products to not only cater to our current customer base but also attract customers who don't conform to traditional gender norms. 🌈
- Lastly, I looked at the industries our customers come from and noticed that a large portion of our profits comes from customers in the Manufacturing and Financial sectors.
